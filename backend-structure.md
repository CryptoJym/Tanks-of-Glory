## Core Components

### Game Server

#### Game Logic Service
- Manages core gameplay rules and mechanics
- Handles tank movement, combat, and interaction
- Validates player actions and enforces game rules
- Processes win/loss conditions and score tracking

#### Physics Engine
- Calculates realistic movement and collisions
- Manages projectile trajectories and impacts
- Processes destructible environment interactions
- Optimizes calculations for multiplayer synchronization

#### AI Controller
- Controls computer-operated tanks
- Implements difficulty levels and behavior patterns
- Uses pathfinding algorithms for navigation
- Simulates human-like decision making and combat strategies

#### World State Manager
- Maintains the current state of the game world
- Tracks positions of all entities and their states
- Manages dynamic environment changes
- Handles state synchronization between server and clients

### Multiplayer Service

#### Matchmaking System
- Pairs players based on skill level and preferences
- Manages game lobbies and room creation
- Handles team balancing and game mode selection
- Implements queue management for waiting players

#### Session Manager
- Maintains active game sessions
- Handles player joining/leaving mid-game
- Manages reconnection logic for dropped connections
- Controls session lifecycle (creation, running, termination)

#### Real-time Communication
- Implements WebSocket connections for low-latency updates
- Manages synchronization of game state across clients
- Optimizes network traffic using delta compression
- Handles network latency compensation techniques

### User Management

#### Authentication Service
- Manages user registration and login
- Implements secure token-based authentication
- Integrates with third-party auth providers (optional)
- Handles session security and token refreshing

#### Profile Manager
- Stores and retrieves user profiles
- Manages player customization options
- Handles friend lists and social connections
- Tracks player statistics and history

#### Progression System
- Manages experience points and level progression
- Tracks unlockable content and achievements
- Handles tank upgrades and skill tree advancement
- Stores player inventory and loadouts

### Data Services

#### Game State Persistence
- Stores game progress and saves
- Implements database transactions for critical operations
- Handles data backup and recovery processes
- Manages data migration during updates

#### Leaderboards
- Tracks and displays global and friend rankings
- Processes and validates score submissions
- Manages seasonal leaderboard resets
- Implements anti-cheat measures for leaderboard integrity

#### Analytics Collection
- Gathers gameplay metrics and user behavior data
- Tracks performance and error metrics
- Generates reports for balance tuning and game improvement
- Ensures compliance with privacy regulations

### Content Delivery

#### Asset Management
- Handles game assets (models, textures, audio)
- Implements content caching strategies
- Manages versioning of assets
- Optimizes asset delivery based on platform

#### Update Distribution
- Manages game patches and updates
- Implements differential updates to minimize download size
- Handles update notifications and installation
- Manages version compatibility

#### DLC Management
- Controls access to downloadable content
- Manages entitlements and purchases
- Handles DLC installation and integration
- Supports content packs and expansion delivery

## Technology Stack

- **Server Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Game Engine Integration**: Custom WebSocket API for Unity/Unreal Engine
- **Database**: 
  - MongoDB for user data and non-relational content
  - Redis for caching and real-time data
  - PostgreSQL for structured data and leaderboards
- **Networking**: 
  - WebSockets for real-time communication
  - REST API for non-real-time operations
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: 
  - Containerized microservices (Docker)
  - Kubernetes for orchestration
  - Regional deployment for latency reduction
- **DevOps**:
  - CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
  - Monitoring and logging infrastructure
  - Auto-scaling based on player load

## Security Considerations

- Implement DDoS protection and rate limiting
- Secure player data with encryption at rest and in transit
- Employ server-side validation for all game actions
- Implement anti-cheat systems and detection mechanisms
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Scalability Strategy

- Horizontal scaling of game servers during peak hours
- Regional server clusters to minimize latency for players
- Database sharding for handling large user bases
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Load balancing across multiple server instances

## Deployment Pipeline

- Development environments for feature testing
- Staging environments for integration testing
- Production deployment with blue/green strategy
- Automated rollbacks for critical issues
- Scheduled maintenance windows for major updates
