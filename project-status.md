## Current Sprint Focus (Sprint #3: June 1-15, 2023)

- Finalize tank control mechanics and physics implementation
- Complete the first playable environment (Desert Arena)
- Implement basic AI for enemy tanks
- Develop core combat system with primary weapons
- Create UI mockups for main game HUD

## Team Allocation

| Department | Team Size | Current Focus |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| Design | 4 | Game mechanics, level design, balancing |
| Programming | 6 | Core engine, physics, controls |
| Art | 5 | Environmental assets, tank models, UI |
| Audio | 2 | Sound effect library, ambient audio |
| QA | 2 | Testing framework, automation setup |
| Production | 3 | Sprint planning, resource management |

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Physics system complexity | High | Medium | Dedicated physics programmer, regular prototyping milestones |
| Art pipeline bottlenecks | Medium | High | Implement asset prioritization system, consider outsourcing |
| Multiplayer netcode challenges | High | High | Early networking proof-of-concept, expert consultation |
| Platform certification delays | Medium | Low | Build certification requirements into sprint planning |
| Scope creep | High | Medium | Regular backlog refinement, strict change request process |

## Technical Debt

- Temporary physics implementation needs refactoring before Alpha
- Current AI pathfinding solution not optimized for complex terrain
- UI system using placeholder framework pending custom implementation
- Early asset pipeline requires optimization for quicker iteration

## Quality Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Frame Rate | 60 FPS | 55-60 FPS | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Optimization |
| Load Times | < 10 seconds | 15 seconds | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Optimization |
| Memory Usage | < 4 GB | 3.2 GB | ‚úÖ Within Range |
| Critical Bugs | 0 | 3 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Being Addressed |
| Test Coverage | > 80% | 65% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Below Target |
